NAME

    Catalyst::Plugin::Devel::InPageLogs - append Catalyst request debug 
        messages to output HTML web page

SYNOPSIS

        use Catalyst 'Devel::InPageLogs';

        # These are the default values
        __PACKAGE__->config->{inpagelogs} = { 
            enabled    => 1,
            passthru   => 1,
            addcaller  => 1,
            shortnames => 'dbg,dbgf',
        };

        # In MyApp::C::SuperHero
        $c->dbgf( "Leaped over %d tall buildings", $count );

DESCRIPTION

    This plugin module for the Catalyst framework provides a means to
    capture debugging messages and append them to the end of web page
    output.  The automatic display of debug messages in the same web page
    with normal HTML output can be very convenient during development.

    One way to think about this plugin is to compare it with the Unix 'tee'
    command.  Debug log messages continue to display using the core logger
    Catalyst::Log, but are also captured and displayed in the browser.

    Almost all debug/info/etc. messages created during processing of one
    HTTP request are returned in the generated HTML page, grouped together
    and appended to the end of the displayed HTML.  A few core debug
    messages are missed at end of a request (see "LIMITATIONS").

    Please note that only during processing of requests are debug messages
    are captured and displayed.  This means the only debug calls from
    controller, model, and view routines will be handled.  This is not a
    real limitation as only these messages *could* be added to the web page.

    If care for security issues is taken then this facility could even be
    enabled at will using URL parameters.  This could be *very* helpful when
    only the beta tester's browser is close at hand.

    In addition to the normal debug, warn, etc. routines documented for
    Catalyst::Log, this plugin adds two convenience methods.  These two
    methods combine shorter names with added information noting the calling
    location.  One of these add-on methods also conveniently handles sprintf
    formatting.

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

    perl Build.PL
    ./Build
    ./Build test
    ./Build install

Alternatively, to install without Module::Build, you can use the 
following commands:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install


DEPENDENCIES

Catalyst


CONFIGURATION OPTIONS

    Some plugin behavior can be controlled by configuration options.  You
    can modify the defaults by specifying values using the
    "__PACKAGE__->config->{inpagelogs}" key.

  enabled

    The plugin can be disabled by setting this value to zero.  You may want
    to do this to leave the code unchanged but prevent debug output from
    being seen when not in development.  A warning log message will be
    generated noting that the plugin is installed but disabled.

  passthru

    The plugin defaults to 'tee' mode - passing calls to debug/warn/etc.  to
    the core logger after capturing them.  Messages will be displayed in
    both the normal log and in the web page.

    If you want debug messages displayed only in the web page you can set
    this config value to zero.

  shortnames

    As a convenience for the developer, the plugin will define short name
    aliases for the add-on debug routines.

    You may change the short name symbol definitions used if the defaults
    would conflict with existing other code.  Set the config value to a
    string of two name symbols separated by a comma:

            shortname => "bugout,bugfmt",

    The first name is aliased to the "capture a set of messages" routine. 
    The second name is aliased to the "format a message and capture it"
    routine.

  addcaller

    The add-on debug routines (normally 'dbg' and 'dbgf') will record caller
    information in each message.  The calling filename and linenumber will
    be added after the timestamp.

    If you do not want this added information, set this config value to
    zero.

METHODS

  EXTENDED METHODS

   prepare_request

    Setup plugin-specific data area in the current request.

    This plugin method will create and attach a work area to the current
    request context.  The work area will contain the array used to collect
    the captured debug messages.  The existing core logger object reference
    is saved before installing our own logger object.

   finalize

    This plugin method will check whether captured debug messages can be
    appended to the current output body.  Only content type 'text/html'
    output will be updated.

    The saved previous logger object will be restored at this point.

  INTERNAL METHODS

   inpagelogs_data  - access to plugin-specific data area

        $data_area = $c->inpagelogs_data;

    Return reference to work area for this plugin during this request.  If
    no work area was created (perhaps because plugin is disabled) then
    "undef" is returned.

   inpagelogs_config   - access to plugin-specific config area

        $config_area = $c->inpagelogs_config;

    Return reference to config hash section for this plugin, if present. 
    Otherwise "undef" will be returned.

   is_inpagelogs_enabled - check config flag

        return  unless $c->is_inpagelogs_enabled;

    The default is to assume the installed plugin is enabled, unless

    'inpagelogs' config section is present, and
    'enabled' flag value is present, and
    the value is set to zero

  PUBLIC METHODS

   inpagelogs_add_msg - add messages to our capture array

        $c->inpagelogs_add_msg( 
                'Whoa! What they said!', 
                "  parameter was '$he_said_she_said'" );

    This method will take one or more strings and save them in the capture
    buffer for later display.

    The only formatting done is to add a "\n" to the end of every string
    that does not already end with "\n".

   inpagelogs_log_msg   - capture debug messages

    Add a list of strings to captured debug messages.

   inpagelogs_log_msgf  - sprintf format parameters and capture debug message

        $c->inpagelogs_log_msgf( "I saw a huge number '%12.3g'\n", $value );

    Process a format and parameters using sprintf, then add result to
    captured debug messages.

   inpagelogs_log_msgsub  - internal debug message capture routine

    This routine handles the final formatting of messages added to the
    capture array.

    The formatted current time will prefix the first message.  The time is
    formatted using overridable routine "_log_time_formatter".

    By default the caller information, filename and line number, will be
    formatted and also added before the first message.  This can be
    controlled by configuration option "addcaller".

LIMITATIONS

  MISSED MESSAGES

    Due to the sequence of Catalyst internal operations and calls to the
    plugin methods, some debug messages at the very end of processing for a
    request cannot be seen by this plugin.

    Specifically (and most regretably) the displayed output table showing
    the actions executed for the request are not captured, e.g.

      [Wed Aug  3 16:30:39 2005] [catalyst] [info] Request took 0.27s (3.70/s)
      .=---------------------------------------------+----------=.
      | Action                                       | Time      |
      |=---------------------------------------------+----------=|
      | /begin                                       | 0.000955s |
      | -> /user/upld/phase2page                     | 0.000614s |
      | /user/upld/phase1                            | 0.002515s |
      | -> Widget::V::TT->process                    | 0.228791s |
      | /user/upld/end                               | 0.230610s |
      '=---------------------------------------------+----------='

    will not be seen except in the core logger output.

  NOT INTEGRATED WITH DEFAULT ERROR PAGE

    The 'pretty' error page displayed by Catalyst upon an exception does not
    include any debug messages captured by this plugin.

TODOS

    Figure out how to add our messages to Catalyst exception page
    Propose patch to move logging of action execution summary earlier?
    Use check "if ( $c->isa('Catalyst::Plugin::Devel::InPageLogs') )" ?
